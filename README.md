# Donation Station

This Sinatra app is meant to help donors keep track of their donations and charities. The charities are added by the users with a name and brief description. All users can see a list of all charities, and users can edit or delete charities that they have created. Users can add donations that can only be viewed on their personal profile. They can change or delete their own donations. It's a userful app to keep track of your giving all in one place.
